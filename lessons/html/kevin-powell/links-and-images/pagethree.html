        <h2>PNGs</h2>

        <p>PNGs are great for icons, logos, technical diagrams, etc. They are larger file sizes. Supports transparency.</p>

        <h2>SVGs</h2>

        <p>SVGs are vector-based. Great for responsive design - same use cases as PNG.</p>

        <img src="./test/other/images/mochi.svg" alt="mochi svg" height="150">

        <!-- Giving one size proportionally resized the other -->

        <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
